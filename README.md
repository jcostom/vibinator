# vibinator

This is a complementary app to my [plugmon app](https://github.com/jcostom/plugmon). I'm using plugmon to monitor the Etekcity smart plug that our washer is plugged into. This enables me to tell when the washer is done.

Ordinarily, I'd just recycle the code and use the same to keep an eye on the dryer, but there's a problem. You see, we've got an electric dryer, and nobody makes a smart plug for a 240V 30A appliance like a dryer. If we got a gas dryer, this would be easy, but I'm not dropping that kind of cash just to get this done.

So, instead of monitoring voltage, we'll look at vibration. When the dryer is running, it's vibrating. So now, I sit, waiting for my movement sensors to come from China. More updates when those get here...
